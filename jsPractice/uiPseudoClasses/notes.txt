different UI pseudo-classes available

:hover
:focus
:active 

the most useful are 
:required :optional :valid :invalid :in-range :out-of-range
:enabled :disabled :read-only :read-write 
:checked :default :indeterminate 

The idea is that we can use the ::before and ::after 
pseudo-elements along with the content property to make a chunk of content appear before or after the affected element.
